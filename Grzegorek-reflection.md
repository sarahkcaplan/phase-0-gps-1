#What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
I was struggling with differentiating between git pull and git clone, but also when a pull request was needed. It was helpful to talk it out with someone who was also learning and figure it out together. 
#What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
How to resolve a merge conflict. This wasn't quite touched upon in detail during the assignments, but it was made obvious once we tried it together. Very helpful for us both. 
#What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
Our partner and I discussed working style and how we like to work. We talked about git remote with the guide. 
#What still confuses you about Git?
How exactly to revert back to a previous commit and when one would want to do so. Also after pushing feature branchs to GitHub, must we always delete the feature branch locally? 
#How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
Went great. I was fortunate to have an exceptional partner and we were able to really figure out the problems together. Her work style and the discussion between us really helped me understand the concepts. 10/10 would recommend to a friend.
