# GPS 1.1 Reflections
## Sarah Caplan


* What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?

  *Merging and pushing*


* What concepts were clarified during the GPS?

  *Pulling into a specific branch vs the master branch*


* What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?

  *How do you initiate a pull request from the git CLI?*


* What still confuses you about Git?

  *Cloning vs fetching master branch vs pulling master branch. And do you push code if you're working on a team? Or do you only make pull requests?*


* How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?

  *Good! Fun, even :) A little shaky in the first hour but then we got in a good groove the second hour*
